Steganography is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection.
In computing or electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Generally, the hidden messages appear to be or to be part of something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text.
For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter.
Some implementations of steganography that lack a shared secret are forms of security through obscurity.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny.
Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.

Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files.
In digital steganography, electronic communications may include coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program, or protocol.
Media files are ideal for transmission because of their large size.
For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet.
The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.
